## "Evercraft" Solution
### from Coding Dojo at [Clean Code Days](http://www.cleancode-days.de/) 2015

This is the original result of the 3,5h coding dojo session at the [Clean Code Days](http://www.cleancode-days.de/) 2015.
It was implemented in [Randori Kata style](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?RandoriKata) with Ping Pong Pairing.
At some point the group decided to introduce the [Test Data Builder pattern](http://slideshare.net/BjrnKimminich/practicing-advanced-unit-testing#23) to increase test legibility.

It was a very entertaining session, and while we got only 3/4 through [Iteration 1](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata#iteration-1---core) everyone "leveled up":
* +2 to TDD
* +1 to Java
* +1 attack and +2 damage when attacking with a German keyboard layout (double bonus if character is non-German)
* Achieved Bonus Feats
  * Test Data Builder Builder
  * Eclipse Shortcut Shortener
